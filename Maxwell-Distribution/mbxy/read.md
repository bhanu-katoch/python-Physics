In xy plot of MB,Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution, function we have transform x values of speed(x,0) to xy values of speed(x,y).

Now if let's say we have 5 as magnitude in 2-D plot of MB ,then in 3-D plot of MB there are n possible values wrt 5 as speed.

Magnitude of speed is given by (vx^2 + vy^2)^0.5
